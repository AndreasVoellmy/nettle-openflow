MODIFY NETKIT FILESYSTEM
========================
It is necessary to install OpenFlow, Haskell, and possibly other tools
onto the filesystems distributed by Netkit. Here are the basic
instructions for doing this.

Download latest kernel and filesystem into a new directory. Run:

    wget http://wiki.netkit.org/download/netkit-filesystem/<netkit-filesystem-verX.tar.bz2>
    wget http://wiki.netkit.org/download/netkit-kernel/<netkit-kernel-verX.tar.bz2>
    tar xjSf netkit-filesystem-verX.tar.bz2
    tar xjSf netkit-kernel-verX.tar.bz2


Modify netkit.conf. Increase maximum allowable memory by setting:

    MAX_MEM=1024

Start UML machine:

    vstart -k ~/netkit/kernel/<netkit-kernel-verX> -m ~/netkit/fs/<netkit-fs-verX> -W -M 1024 --eth0=tap,10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2 pc1

Be sure to use absolute paths in above command, especially for the
kernel because kernel modules otherwise fail to load. We assumed you
unpacked the filesystem and kernl in your home directory; modify as
needed.

Set DNS nameserver. In UML instance, add following line to
/etc/resolv.conf

    nameserver 8.8.8.8

This is a nameserver run by google and provided for use by general
public. You should now have access to the internet, and can download
and install any packages needed.

When finished, unset nameserver by removing the line added above in
/etc/resolv.conf.

Shutdown the machine by running

    vhalt pc1

from the host machine. The model filesystem will now have the changes
you made.
