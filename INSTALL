WARNING: The instructions below are very outdated. 

Install Nettle
=====================================================================
Library will be downloaded from Hackage automatically, compiled, and 
installed. Documentation will also be generated and installed in the
default system location.

Just run:

  cabal install nettle

You will still need to install the .nettle directory for some
functionality.


Compiling Individual Applications
=====================================================================
A sample application is included in the src/Examples/ directory. 
After installing, it can be compiled using "ghc --make" 
(see ghc documentation for details). For example, you can build
the example application by moving to 
src/Examples/SimpleImperativeIONetworkControl and then running

  ghc --make NetLearningSwitch.hs


Install Nekit
=====================================================================
Netkit can be used to run OpenFlow on virtualized switches. You
should follow the instructions at http://netkit.org to install
it. However, there are known bugs as of the 2009/11/26 release of
Netkit. After installation, please also do the following to fix
these. Let <netkit> denote the directory in which you installed
Netkit.

[Netkit Bug](http://bugs.netkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9)
------------------------------------------------------
To fix, in <netkit>/bin/script_utils, line 271:
Replace the double equal sign `==` with a single equal sign `=`.

Netkit Bug: Kernel modules do not load.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Reported by Ashish in email to Netkit mailing list dated 20-Jul-2010.
To fix, in <netkit>/bin/vstart, change line 536 as follows:
-KERNEL_MODULES_DIRECTORY=`dirname $VM_KERNEL`/modules
+eval KERNEL_MODULES_DIRECTORY=`dirname $VM_KERNEL`/modules


Copy .nettle Configuration Directory
=====================================================================
This directory contains specific files that can be used to run
OpenFlow networks in Netkit labs. We recommend that this
directory be named ".nettle" and be within your home directory.
