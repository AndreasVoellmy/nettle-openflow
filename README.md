# OpenFlow [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AndreasVoellmy/openflow.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/AndreasVoellmy/openflow)

OpenFlow is a Haskell library that implements OpenFlow protocols 1.0 and 1.3. It defines data types that model the logical content of the various OpenFlow protocol messages and provides serialization and deserialization methods using the [binary package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/binary). It also provides basic functions to start servers that use these representations.
